# Credit card fraud detection

This ML project is based on the credit card fraud detection dataset from kaggle.
The objective on this dataset is a classification task of segregating 'fraud' & 'not-fraud' datapoints, with a highly imbalanced distribution. (only 0.173% of 2.8L datapoints are labelled as fraud)
The entire approach towards solving the problem has been explained in detail in the Jupyter notebook.

Following are the key points regarding the project:
1) Since the problem was solved using cascading, the files have been labelled as L1, L2, L3, L4 representing each layer of the ensemble.
2) If you want to run the files on your PC, you will need to paste the raw data in the 'dataset' folder from the kaggle link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
3) All the files need to be run sequentially as per the names. (L1a, L1b, L1c, L2a,...)
